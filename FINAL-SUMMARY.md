## 🔑 KEY SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Follow the plan exactly**
   - Don't skip ahead
   - Do prompts in order
   - Git commit after each phase

2. **Use Copilot aggressively**
   - Let it generate 80% of code
   - Your job: integrate + test
   - Not: write everything manually

3. **Test as you go**
   - After each prompt, test locally
   - Fix errors immediately
   - Don't accumulate tech debt

4. **Stay on timeline**
   - Friday: Setup (non-negotiable)
   - Saturday: Core features
   - Sunday: Polish
   - Monday: Ship

5. **Git discipline**
   - Commit after each phase
   - Clear commit messages
   - History should tell story

## 🚨 COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

❌ **"Let me read the entire plan first"**
→ Don't. Read 15 min intro, then start coding.

❌ **"Copilot generated code that's not perfect"**
→ Normal. Your job to review and tweak, not rewrite everything.

❌ **"I need to understand everything before building"**
→ Learn by building. Understand as you code.

❌ **"Let me add this extra feature"**
→ Stick to MVP. 3 use cases. Nothing more.

❌ **"I'll deploy to GCP/AWS now"**
→ Deploy on Monday. Just test locally this weekend.

❌ **"I'll refactor later"**
→ No. Keep code as Copilot generates. It's clean enough.

## 💡 PRO TIPS

1. **Create a separate terminal for each service**
   ```bash
   Terminal 1: cd extension && npm run dev
   Terminal 2: cd webapp && npm run dev
   Terminal 3: For git commits
   ```

2. **Test extension in chrome://extensions**
   - Reload extension after changes
   - Check DevTools for errors
   - Load from `dist/` folder

3. **Use Copilot for debugging**
   - "I got this error: [error]"
   - "Fix this: [code]"
   - Copilot is great at debugging

4. **Keep API keys in .env**
   - Never commit secrets
   - .gitignore added by Next.js
   - Safe to share repo on GitHub later

5. **Test one feature at a time**
   - Don't build everything then test
   - Test each prompt result immediately
   - Faster to catch issues
