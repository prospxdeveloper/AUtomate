ThirdLayer, Inc.: Revolutionizing Browser-Based Workflows with Dex
Executive Summary
ThirdLayer, Inc. is an innovative applied research and product lab transforming how people interact with artificial intelligence in their daily workflows. Founded in 2025 by Kevin Gu and Regina Lin, the company is backed by Y Combinator (Winter 2025 batch) and leading investors in deep tech, HCI, and consumer technology[1][2]. Based in San Francisco, ThirdLayer has developed Dex, the world's first AI browser copilot—a groundbreaking solution that integrates intelligence directly into the browser, turning Chrome into an intelligent personal workspace[1].
Rather than forcing users into separate AI chat interfaces, Dex embeds context-aware AI assistance directly where work happens: in your browser, across your tabs, and within your existing tools. The platform solves a critical gap in AI adoption: while language models have advanced exponentially, the interfaces through which users interact with them remain static and disconnected from real workflows[2].
Company Overview
Mission and Vision
ThirdLayer is reimagining the interface between humans and artificial intelligence. The company's core mission is to build systems that extend how people think and move, augmenting human capability rather than replacing it[2].
The founding vision emerged from a personal pain point: founders Kevin and Regina observed the inefficiencies plaguing knowledge workers, particularly in industries like investment banking where people work extreme hours juggling between broken software systems. Instead of designing yet another AI chat, they asked a fundamental question: What if the browser itself became intelligent?[2]
Each major shift in computing has come from better human-machine interaction—from hardware, to operating systems, to graphical interfaces. ThirdLayer believes the next leap isn't just more powerful AI models, but a new kind of interface built for intelligence: one that understands context, adapts to user intent, and works within existing workflows rather than demanding adaptation to new tools[2].
Team and Expertise
ThirdLayer is led by co-founders with exceptional credentials:
•	Kevin Gu - Co-Founder and CEO, Harvard graduate with degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science & Engineering[2]

The Problem: Modern Work is Broken
The Context Switching Bottleneck
Modern knowledge work is fundamentally broken. Today's reality for millions of professionals:
•	Managing 15+ open browser tabs simultaneously[2]
•	Constant context switching between disconnected applications[2]
•	Information silos: Gmail, Google Sheets, Jira, GitHub, Slack—each operating independently[2]
•	Manual data entry and repetitive tasks consuming hours daily[2]
•	Existing AI tools stuck behind chat interfaces disconnected from actual work[1][2]
The core bottleneck isn't just automation—it's context switching and interface friction. Each app switch breaks focus. Every tool requires learning new shortcuts. AI assistants operate in isolated chats, forcing users to context-switch and manually translate AI responses back into their work[2].
Why Current Solutions Fall Short
Traditional AI web agents: Most are "set-and-forget" chats—you hand off a task and check back later with no real-time visibility. This friction is unacceptable for workflows requiring instant feedback and responsive action[1].
Static interfaces: UIs haven't evolved to support intelligence. They can't adapt, anticipate, or understand real context[2].
Ecosystem silos: Every AI platform is another closed ecosystem—locked in chats, dashboards, or proprietary tooling rather than living in the browser where work actually happens[2].
Dex: The Solution
What is Dex?
Dex is an AI copilot for your browser—a Chrome extension that transforms your browser into an intelligent, context-aware personal workspace[1][2]. Rather than replacing your tools, Dex enhances and orchestrates them, working alongside you rather than around you[1][2].
Think of Dex as "Spotlight Search meets AI automation + personal expert for everyday apps"—available through simple voice and text commands directly in your browser[1].
Accessibility: Available at https://www.joindex.com or as a Chrome extension via the Chrome Web Store (search "Dex")[1][3]
Availability: Free plan available with Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers for advanced features and higher usage[1]
Launch date: December 2025 (newly launched)[1][2]
Core Philosophy: "Cursor for Your Browser"
ThirdLayer took a deliberate design approach inspired by Cursor (an AI-enhanced code editor) rather than attempting a "Devin" model (an autonomous AI agent). The key difference[1]:
•	Cursor approach: AI that works with you, providing instant feedback and responsive action as you drive workflows
•	Devin approach: AI that works for you, handling tasks autonomously with slow feedback loops and reduced visibility
Dex chose the faster, more collaborative path—enabling you to maintain control and real-time context while getting AI-powered assistance[1].
Technical Architecture
Behind Dex's user-friendly interface lies sophisticated technical infrastructure addressing core challenges[2]:
 	Multiagent Orchestration — Coordinated sub-agents mixing tool-use and browser control for complex, multi-step workflows
 	Living Memory — A context engine that learns workflows, denoises actions, and retrieves information with precision
 	Intent-Aware Perception — Linking on-screen state to user goals, powering adaptive, intelligent interfaces
 	Trajectory Prediction — Predicting personalized action flows into full workflows that build trust and enable proactive assistance
Infrastructure partners: AWS, Supabase, Google Cloud Platform, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Turbopuffer[3]

The company's deep technical expertise in multiagent systems, memory architectures, and intent prediction, combined with a founding vision rooted in solving real problems for knowledge workers, positions ThirdLayer as a meaningful innovation in the AI space[2].
As AI capabilities continue advancing, the interface becomes increasingly critical. Dex demonstrates that the next wave of AI adoption won't come from more powerful models, but from fundamentally better interfaces that honor how people actually work. By embedding intelligence directly into the browser, learning from user behavior, and supporting complex multi-step workflows, Dex makes AI a practical tool for everyday productivity—not just a novelty experiment[1][2].
For knowledge workers drowning in tabs, context switching, and manual data manipulation, Dex offers a practical path forward: an AI copilot that understands your work and helps you do it 10x faster—without breaking your flow[1].
